# Linux-Info

API in Perl to recover information about the running Linux OS

## WARNING

The version 2.0 and beyond brakes compatibility with the
`Linux::Info::DiskStats module` in previuous versions.

Be sure to read the related documentation to avoid issues when upgrading.

## DESCRIPTION

`Linux::Info` is a fork from [Sys::Statistics::Linux](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sys::Statistics::Linux) distribution.

`Linux::Info` is a front-end module to gather different linux
system information like processor workload, memory usage, network and
disk statistics and a lot more. Refer the documentation of the
distribution modules to get more information about all possible
statistics.

By obvious reasons, this distribution will run only at Linux O.S.

## MOTIVATION

`Sys::Statistics::Linux` is a great distribution (and I used it a lot),
but it was built to recover only Linux statistics when I was also
looking for other additional information about the OS.

`Linux::Info` will provide additional information not available in
`Sys::Statistics::Linux`, as general processor information and hopefully
apply patches and suggestions not implemented in the original project.

`Sys::Statistics::Linux` is also more forgiving regarding compatibility
with older perls interpreters, modules version that it depends on and
even older OS. If you find that `Linux::Info` is not available to your old
system, you should try it.

### What is different from Sys::Statistics::Linux?

`Linux::Info` has:

- a more modern Perl 5 code;
- doesn't use `exec` syscall to acquire information;
- provides additional information about the processors;
- higher Kwalitee;

## INSTALL

To install this module, unpack the downloaded tarball and execute the following
commands in the created directory:

```
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
```

`Linux::Info` is also available on CPAN, so you can also download and install
automatically this distribution, dependencies included, by using the CPAN shell
(or CPAN Minus or whatever you prefer).

If you prefer to use it directly from the Github repository, you can also use
the `cpanfile` included to take care of the dependencies without installing
`Dist::Zilla` (see `cpanm --installdeps`).
